Image Generation Project with GAN

This project focuses on generating anime faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). 
The GAN learns from the Anime Face Dataset available on Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset) to create unique and realistic anime-style images.
